# CT Dynamic Myelography Protocols

## Overview

This repository contains the imaging protocols for CT Dynamic Myelography for Spontaneous Intracranial Hypotension. All protocols are dynamically scanning utilizing Ultra High Resolution (UHR).

### Intrathecal Contrast Injection

The intrathecal injection is performed as follows:
- Using a Three-way stopcock.
- First, inject 10 ml NaCl into the spinal canal.
- Then, during a 30-second injection, administer 8 ml of IV contrast, followed by 10 ml NaCl to push the contrast.
- The contrast injection is ongoing during the dynamic scan.

### Exported Protocols

- 5.50 DT Myelografi CSF-fistel
- 5.51 DT Myelografi CSF-fistel XXL
- 5.60 DT Myelografi lateralt CSF-läckage
- 5.61 DT Myelografi ventralt CSF-läckage
